use_terraform_files.py is used to deploy an EC2 instance using the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI. The code also applies some basic apache and html items to show the instance can be accessed via a browser after deployment.

The code currently uses existing security groups, this would need to be changed per environment or purpose.
